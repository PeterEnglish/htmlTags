        We should not think about how the tag is rendered on the page,
        but the meaning behind the use of the element, as the appearance
        can be easily changed with css.

    <p><em>This is also a very important piece of content</em></p>

     <!--
        If you were to change a p to a div, you would not see much of
        a change in appearance, however the SEMANTICS of the page changes.
        -Use main, nav header and footer instead of divs when you can.
        +Search engines can analyse the page better.
